The names on this list were recommended to the Bishop by the Diocesan Review Board whose members include lay professionals with expertise in law enforcement, mental health, and children's health.  The persons named in this report have been included because the allegations against them were deemed credible.  By that determination, the Diocese of Gallup is not making a definitive statement as to the veracity of the allegations nor the guilt of the accused, only that the allegations are serious and have not been discredited.  By their very nature, these allegations are grave but only a court of law has the authority to determine guilt or innocence.
